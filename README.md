🐍 **Automating File Management with Python** 🐍

Are you tired of manually managing your downloads folder? Let Python take the reins with this handy script that identifies and moves old files to a designated 'to_delete' folder. 👋

**Prerequisites:**

* Python installed on your system (duh!) 🤓

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python script (.py)
2. Run the script using Python
3. Watch as your downloads folder gets automagically decluttered! 🎉

**Happy Automating!** 🤖

Let Python be your file management sidekick and enjoy a cleaner, more organized downloads folder. 😎
